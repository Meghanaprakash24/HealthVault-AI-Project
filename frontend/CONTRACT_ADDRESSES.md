# Contract Addresses

After running `truffle migrate --reset`, copy the addresses from the terminal output and add them to your `.env` file.

Based on your build artifacts, these are the current deployed addresses:

```
VITE_PATIENT_CONTRACT_ADDRESS=0xfaF02B1B3087B4F7A5D2cac1b1f349024791FC60
VITE_DOCTOR_CONTRACT_ADDRESS=0x584962Ab92E0bE4F4127a7A334b0FFf30116B1e6
VITE_DIAGNOSIS_CONTRACT_ADDRESS=0x4E469CeCaf1bD7a3FfB2A1995aeb5C456984eE34
```

**Note:** After running `truffle migrate --reset` again, these addresses might change. Always use the addresses from the latest migration output!
